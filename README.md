## Lyrics

```
ey hallowed duty such a trait (or)
(time) to outplay the life 
caught in draught, stuck in dreaded flow 
i'm born and dead (now i rest)
i was gonna say - away
treat reflects (---) into rage ya
deal respect, feel the lies
different flex (ey ya)


grasp the raw excess 
turn it into flaws, that in spades
navigating among sortie, 
sorted, seeding networked distrust
breaks the order
clearing murder pings of hate
feeling pity nothing more than
small revenge in my head

put some thought (in)
on a fucking end of game ya
let's not cut your reign
dish out all the pain ya
aye
flay it slay it
on your way up
welcome to the black
vacuum's
making records wicked TRAP
aye

track

traitor

stacking rack
deflect fakes 

know your kind
before you step up
break up lays
crest ya brah
write it up
fucking did it


dice
trice
lies
mice
die
tries
brace
face

ey hello duty
searching the trip to pay the lies
cutting  jaws
stacking credit flowing morn and day
all is good i stay away
treat to flex
continue to rage
feel respect, deal the lies
good reflex ye

rest in noise
still, still into the floss
i need space not negating
to reach the higher stories
frequencies in the story
distress
putting all the things in faith
damn mornings


push out all the gains ya

make it stack
