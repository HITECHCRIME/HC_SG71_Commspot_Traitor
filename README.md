## Lyrics

```
ey hallowed duty such a trait
(time) to outplay the life 
caught in draught, stuck in dreaded flow 
i'm born and dead (now i rest)
i was gonna say - away
treat reflects (---) into rage ya
deal respect, feel the lies
different flex (ey ya)

grasp the raw excess 
turn it into flaws, that in spades
navigating among sortie, 
sorted, seeding networked distrust
breaks the order
clearing murder pings of hate
feeling pity nothing more than
small revenge in my head

put some thought (in)
on a fucking end of game ya
let's not cut your reign
dish out all the pain ya
aye
flay it slay it
on your way up
welcome to the black
vacuum's
making records wicked track TRAP
aye

stacking rack
deflect fakes 

know your kind
before you step up
break up lays
crest ya brah
write it up
fucking did it


dice
trice
lies
mice
die
tries
brace
face
