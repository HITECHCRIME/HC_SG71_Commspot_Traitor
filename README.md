## Lyrics

```
ey hallowed duty such a trait 
to play the life, caught in draught
stuck in dreaded flow i'm born and dead (now i rest)
i was gonna say - away
treat reflects - into rage (ya)
deal respect, feel the lies, 
different flex (ya)

grasp the raw excess 
turn it into flaws, that in spades
navigating among sortie, 
sorted, seeding networked distrust
breaks the order
clearing murder pings of hate
feeling pity nothing more than
small revenge in my head

put some thought
on a fucking end of game ya
let's not cut your reign
dish out all the pain ya (aye)
flay it slay it on your way up
welcome to the black - vacuum's
making records wicked trap aye (aye)

(now i rest)
track a  traitor
stacking rack
deflect fakes 

know your kind
before you step up
break up lays
crest ya brah
write it up
fucking did it
not enough

dice
trice
lies
mice
die
tries
brace
face

ey hello duty
searching the trip to pay the lies
cutting  jaws
stacking credit flowing morn and day
all is good i stay away
treat to flex
continue to rage
feel respect, deal the lies
good reflex ye

direspect ye

rest in noise
still, still into the floss
i need space not negating
to reach the higher stories
frequencies in the story
distress, frequency of loss

putting all the things in faith
pity the damn mornings
now with peace (revenge) in my head

push out all the gains ya

make it stack
underway ya
welcome to the rack
make it stack 
remember the favour
